# Module-2-Challenge
My Portfolio

## Description

This weekly challenge was to make a portfolio from scratch containing information about me, my work and my contact information.




## Installation
No source code provided because this was made from scratch. I used some  pictures of my own for the background image and profile pictures. I also included screenshots of several projects I previously worked on in the making of this portfolio.
